If you find it hard to find any other dependency that isn't listed here leave me a message.

Tools:

avrdude-6.1
binutils-2.25
eclipse-cpp-kepler-SR2-linux-gtk-x86_64
gcc-4.9.2
gmp-6.0.0a
mpc-1.0.3
mpfr-3.1.2

My plan was to redistribute copies for those packages, but since I'm using GitHub, I have a
100MB limit per file.

It should be really straighforward to setup everything. Just decompress and compile everything
in a build/ folder inside this folder (Sbrubbles/tools/build). The order of compilations may
be important:

1- Binutils

2- GCC (Extract gmp, mpc and mpfr thogether with GCC. Their folder should not have its version,
   or else it won't work). For example:
   gcc/
   |- mpfr/
   |- mpc/
   |- gmp/
   |- build_gcc/
   |- (other gcc files)

   I strongly suggest you to run ../configure --prefix=... inside build_gcc/ inside gcc/ folder.
   Also, make sure your Binutils binaries are in your PATH (probably in front is better).

3- avrdude

4- eclipse (No compilations needed, just extract it somewhere and place a symbolic link inside
   tools/build/bin so that it is easy to run it).
