# The Sbrubbles Project

The Sbrubbles Project is a repository where I put my Arduino projects. I don't
really like using the Arduino software libraries, but the avr-gcc tools directly
instead.

Note that I only have one arduino with an ATMega1280 microcontroller.
This project is not projected to work in any other platform, but you can
try at your own risk. Leave me a message if you find it to work.
