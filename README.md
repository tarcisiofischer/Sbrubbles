# The Sbrubbles Project

The Sbrubbles Project works like a basic environment plus a library for my
personal Arduino projects.

Note that I only have one arduino with an ATMega1280 microcontroller on it.
This project is not projected to work in any other platform, but you can
try at your own risk. Leave me a message if you find it to work.

explaining what you must have.
